Project description

In this project, we'll create a toggle button that switches the website between dark and light modes, 
with a sliding animation for a more visually appealing transition.
 We'll use keyframe CSS queries to create the animation and 
JavaScript to change the background color dynamically. 
The user's preference will be stored using the browser's local storage, 
ensuring that their selection persists even if they refresh the page. 
This project will teach you advanced CSS techniques, JavaScript programming, 
and how to improve the user experience by storing data in the browser.
