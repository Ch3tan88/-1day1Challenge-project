# -#90Day1Project

AUthor : Chetan Khade


This repository will contain multiple beginner-friendly projects. These projects are a part of the #90Day1Project challenge, where I aim to build a simple and small project every day to enhance my skills.

If you'd like to join this challenge, all you need to do is create a straightforward project each day. As you progress and improve, you have the freedom to choose any programming language you prefer. I've personally chosen JavaScript (JS) for my projects.

Thank you for your interest and support
