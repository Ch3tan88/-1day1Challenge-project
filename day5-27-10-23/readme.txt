 effect that animates when hovering over a button. The final result
 showcases a button on the screen that produces a ripple effect 
starting from the point where the mouse enters. Regardless of the
 entry direction, the effect adapts accordingly, creating a seamless 
and captivating user experience. Achieving this effect involves 
utilizing JavaScript to capture the mouse position and CSS to create 
a visually appealing ripple animation. Executing this project requires a robust grasp of JavaScript and CSS and the ability to apply these skills creatively to produce the desired effect. With our expertise, we can create a beautiful and interactive ripple effect that is sure to impress
